# ChessWrapped 2025
https://chess-wrapped-l8m6.vercel.app/

**A "Spotify Wrapped" style experience for Chess.com users, built with Next.js and the Chess.com Public API.**

This application fetches archived game data for the year 2025, processes statistics client-side (win rates, accuracy, opening preferences), and visualizes the results in an interactive, animated carousel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Data Source:** [Chess.com Public API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)
- **Icons:** Lucide React

## ⚙️ Architecture & Data Flow

1. **User Input:** The user enters their username on the landing page (`app/page.tsx`).
2. **Validation:** The app pings the Chess.com API to verify the user exists and has archives for 2025.
3. **Data Fetching:**
    - On success, the user is routed to `/wrapped/[username]`.
    - The `ChessContext` triggers a fetch for all monthly archives (JSON).
    - Games are parsed to calculate Total Games, Win/Loss/Draw ratios, and specific Opening names.
4. **Visualization:**
    - Data is passed into the `<Carousel />` component.
    - Framer Motion handles the slide transitions and entrance animations.
    - Global Audio is managed in `layout.tsx` to persist across route changes.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
